You want to go on a trip and fly around the world.  However, you have been postponing the purchase of your airplane tickets and you just noticed that airlines use dynamic pricing for the ticket prices.  You have now the choice between being destitute or staying in Antibes.  As students, we are always on the lookout for good deals and  intend to provide a solution for you through an application of machine learning.  Next time, you will be able to fly without breaking the bank.

Our project focuses on the use of dynamic pricing for plane tickets.  We know that ticket prices depend on several factors.  In this project, we are attempting to build a model that will enable us to predict flight prices and thus find the optimal condition to purchase our tickets.

The input to our algorithm is the name of the airline, the code of the flight, the time and city of departure, the time and city of arrival, the number of stops, the class, the duration and the number of days left until the flight.  We then use a decision tree, a random forest, a linear regression and a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to output a predicted price.
